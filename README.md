# Searching in the Internet
John did a search on his favorite search engine and found the answer he was looking for in the third link listed. Also, he saw from the site that t people had 
clicked on this link before. Jo√£o had read previously, also on the Internet, that the number of people who click on the second link listed is twice the number 
of people who click on the third link listed. In that reading, he also found that the number of people who click on the second link is half the number of people 
who click on the first link. John is intrigued to know how many people clicked on the first link in the search, and since you are his friend, you want your help 
in this task.

Input
Each test case has only one number, t, which represents the number of people who clicked on the third link in the search.

Exit
For each test case, print only one line, containing only one integer, indicating how many people clicked on the first link in this search.
